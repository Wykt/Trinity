- [ObjectWeb ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/)

#### Why?
There is a total lack of proper Java reverse engineering tools.

#### Who is this meant for?
Hackers, hobbyists, professionals, everyone is welcome.

#### Context
Originally Trinity started out as an obfuscator with an interactive interface. Over time, I began using it as a decompiler, and eventually it evolved into this awesome tool.
